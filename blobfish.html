            <h1>Blobfish</h1>
        <div class="left">
            <p>The blobfish (Psychrolutes marcidus) is a deep sea fish of the family Psychrolutidae. It inhabits the deep waters off the coasts of mainland Australia and Tasmania, as well as the waters of New Zealand.[1]

Blobfish are typically shorter than 30 cm. They live at depths between 600 and 1,200 m (2,000 and 3,900 ft) where the pressure is 60 to 120 times as great as at sea level, which would likely make gas bladders inefficient for maintaining buoyancy.[1] Instead, the flesh of the blobfish is primarily a gelatinous mass with a density slightly less than water; this allows the fish to float above the sea floor without expending energy on swimming. Its relative lack of muscle is not a disadvantage as it primarily swallows edible matter that floats in front of it such as deep-ocean crustaceans</p>
            <p>In September 2013 the blobfish was voted the "World's Ugliest Animal", <span class="one" style="color:blue">RANDOM TEXT</span> based on photographs of decompressed specimens, and <span class="two" style="color:red">WHAT ARE THOSEEEE</span>adopted as the mascot of the Ugly Animal Preservation Society, in an initiative <span class="three" style="color:green">UGLY FISHHHHH</span>"dedicated to raising the profile of some of Mother Natureâ€™s more aesthetically challenged children"</p>
