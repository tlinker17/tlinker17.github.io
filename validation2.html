<!-- <h1>Practice Validation Assignment</h1>
    <p>Your job is to get this HTML document to validate. In order to do so, you must to go the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input" target="_blank">W3 Validator</a>, paste your code, and then hit check. If you see a green bar with the text "This document was succesfully checked as HTML5!", then you have completed the assignment. A red bar indicates that work still needs to be done before the page meets good validation standards.</p>
    <p><strong>ALL</strong> of the errors on this page are beneath the &lt;hr&gt; tag. In total there are exactly 10 errors/mistypes. If you right-click the page in Google Chrome and select View page source, the HTML for this page will appear. It is important to note that no tags should be deleted. Things should only be added or moved around in order to pass validation. You also do not have to change any styles that I have applied to the page. The primary goal is to focus on the HTML aspect of web development.</p>
    <p>To submit the assignment, you will upload the corrected file to your S-Drive via FileZilla or on a UAlbany computer. The link should look like this: <a href="#">albany.edu/username/201/val-practice.html</a>. Username will be replaced with your personal UAlbany ID.</p>

            Information About Bacon</h2>
                <p class="bacon-info">It seems there has been a bacon explosion in America, in more ways than one. Bacon recipes are sweeping the blogoshere (like the famously fatty <a href="http://blog.bbqaddicts.com/recipes/bacon-explosion/"> bacon explosion</a> appetizer recipe). Fast-food chains are peddling double bacon burgers, and upscale restaurants are wrapping steaks in bacon -- even adding it to chic desserts. That’s right; chocolatiers are sprinkling bacon bits in chocolate bars like they are almonds. It’s the old sweet and savory marriage of flavors that seems to work so well.</p>
                <p><em>Although there's no arguing that bacon is a tasty treat, what about all that fat, sodium, and cholesterol? Is there any way for bacon to be part of a healthy diet?</em></p>

                <p class="bacon-answer">Thankfully, the answer is <strong>YES!</strong> Although bacon has many nurtitional deficiences, it can be part of a healthy diet. This way to do this is through moderation. About one ounce of bacon is enough every so often to avoid negative health effects. However, it should be known that bacon is in the group of meats that are processed and have been shown to increase the risk of cancer.</p>
